\arguments{
\item{cpptsemObject}{model of type cpptsem}

\item{startingValues}{named vector with starting values}

\item{objective}{"ML" for maximum likelihood SEM, "Kalman" for Kalman filter}

\item{lambda}{penalty value}

\item{adaptiveLassoWeights}{named vector with adaptive lasso weights}

\item{regularizedParameters}{named vector of regularized parameters}

\item{eta}{if the current step size fails, eta will decrease the step size. Must be > 1}

\item{sig}{Controls the sigma parameter in Yuan, G.-X., Ho, C.-H., & Lin, C.-J. (2012). An improved GLMNET for l1-regularized logistic regression. The Journal of Machine Learning Research, 13, 1999â€“2030. https://doi.org/10.1145/2020408.2020421, Equation 20. Defaults to 0. Has to be in 0 < sigma < 1}

\item{initialStepsize}{initial stepsize to be tried in the outer iteration}

\item{stepsizeMin}{Minimal acceptable step size. Must be > 0. A larger number corresponds to a smaller step from one to the next iteration. All step sizes will be computed as described by Gong et al. (2013)}

\item{stepsizeMax}{Maximal acceptable step size. Must be > stepsizeMin. A larger number corresponds to a smaller step from one to the next iteration. All step sizes will be computed as described by Gong et al. (2013)}

\item{GISTLinesearchCriterion}{criterion for accepting a step. Possible are 'monotone' which enforces a monotone decrease in the objective function or 'non-monotone' which also accepts some increase.}

\item{GISTNonMonotoneNBack}{in case of non-monotone line search: Number of preceding regM2LL values to consider}

\item{maxIter_out}{maximal number of outer iterations}

\item{maxIter_in}{maximal number of inner iterations}

\item{break_outer}{Stopping criterion for outer iterations. It has to be a named value. By default (name: gradient), a relative first-order condition is checked, where the maximum absolute value of the gradients is compared to break_outer (see https://de.mathworks.com/help/optim/ug/first-order-optimality-measure.html). Alternatively, an absolute tolerance can be passed to the function (e.g., break_outer = c("gradient" = .0001)). Instead of relative gradients, the change in parameters can used as breaking criterion. To this end, use c("parameterChange" = .00001)}

\item{verbose}{set to 1 to print additional information and plot the convergence and 2 for further details.}

\item{silent}{suppress all warning messages}

\details{
GIST minimizes a function of form f(theta) = l(theta) + g(theta), where l is the likelihood and g is a penalty function. Various penalties are supported, however currently only lasso and adaptive lasso are implemented.
